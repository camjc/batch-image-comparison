# batch-image-comparison
Uses GraphicsMagick to visually match up two folders of images with different filenames.


This isn’t generic yet, but may be a useful starting point for someone.

## Running
- Look through index.js, customising (especially paths) to match your needs.
- Install dependencies using `npm i` or `yarn`.
- Install GraphicsMagick using homebrew, apt-get or however you like to.
- Run with `npm run start`.
- Open the html file and have a look at what it has found.
- Use the commands printed on a black background in `node`’s REPL to rename files.
